Scientific Luigi (SciLuigi for short) is a light-weight wrapper library
around `Spotify <http://spotify.com>`__'s
`Luigi <http://github.com/spotify/luigi>`__ workflow system that aims to
make writing scientific workflows more fluent, flexible and modular.

Luigi is a flexile and fun-to-use library. It has turned out though that
its default way of defining dependencies by hard coding them in each
task's requires() function is not optimal for some type of workflows
common e.g. in bioinformatics where multiple inputs and outputs, complex
dependencies, and the need to quickly try different workflow
connectivity in an explorative fashion is central to the way of working.

SciLuigi was designed to solve some of these problems, by providing the
following "features" over vanilla Luigi:

-  Separation of dependency definitions from the tasks themselves, for
   improved modularity and composability.
-  Inputs and outputs implemented as separate fields, a.k.a. "ports", to
   allow specifying dependencies between specific input and
   output-targets rather than just between tasks. This is again to let
   such details of the network definition reside outside the tasks.
-  The fact that inputs and outputs are object fields, also allows
   auto-completion support to ease the network connection work (Works
   great e.g. with
   `jedi-vim <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim>`__).
-  Inputs and outputs are connected with an intuitive "single-assignment
   syntax".
-  "Good default" high-level logging of workflow tasks and execution
   times.
-  Produces an easy to read audit-report with high level information per
   task.
-  Integration with some HPC workload managers. (So far only
   `SLURM <http://slurm.schedmd.com/>`__ though).

Because of Luigi's easy-to-use API these changes have been implemented
as a very thin layer on top of luigi's own API with no changes at all to
the luigi core, which means that you can continue leveraging the work
already being put into maintaining and further developing luigi by the
team at Spotify and others.

Workflow code quick demo
------------------------

***For a brief 10 minute screencast going through the basics below, see
`this link <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkKUWskRbjw>`__***

Just to give a quick feel for how a workflow definition might look like
in SciLuigi, check this code example (implementation of tasks hidden
here for brevity. See Usage section further below for more details):

.. code:: python

    import sciluigi as sl

    class MyWorkflow(sl.WorkflowTask):
        def workflow(self):
            # Initialize tasks:
            foowrt = self.new_task('foowriter', MyFooWriter)
            foorpl = self.new_task('fooreplacer', MyFooReplacer,
                replacement='bar')

            # Here we do the *magic*: Connecting outputs to inputs:
            foorpl.in_foo = foowrt.out_foo

            # Return the last task(s) in the workflow chain.
            return foorpl

That's it! And again, see the "usage" section just below for a more
detailed description of getting to this!

Support: Getting help
---------------------

Please use the `issue
queue <https://github.com/pharmbio/sciluigi/issues>`__ for any support
questions, rather than mailing the author(s) directly, as the solutions
can then help others who face similar issues (we are a very small team
with very limited time, so this is important).

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Python 2.7 - 3.4
-  Luigi 1.3.x - 2.0.1

Install
-------

1. Install SciLuigi, including its dependencies (luigi etc), through
   PyPI:

   .. code:: bash

       pip install sciluigi

2. Now you can use the library by just importing it in your python
   script, like so:

   .. code:: python

       import sciluigi

   Note that you can aliase it to a shorter name, for brevity, and to
   save keystrokes:

   .. code:: python

       import sciluigi as sl

Usage
-----

Creating workflows in SciLuigi differs slightly from how it is done in
vanilla Luigi. Very briefly, it is done in these main steps:

1. Create a workflow tasks class
2. Create task classes
3. Add the workflow definition in the workflow class's ``workflow()``
   method.
4. Add a run method at the end of the script
5. Run the script

Create a Workflow task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first thing to do when creating a workflow, is to define a workflow
task.

You do this by:

1. Creating a subclass of ``sciluigi.WorkflowTask``
2. Implementing the ``workflow()`` method.

Example:
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    import sciluigi

    class MyWorkflow(sciluigi.WorkflowTask):
        def workflow(self):
            pass # TODO: Implement workflow here later!

Create tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then, you need to define some tasks that can be done in this workflow.

This is done by:

1. Creating a subclass of ``sciluigi.Task`` (or ``sciluigi.SlurmTask``
   if you want Slurm support)
2. Adding fields named ``in_<yournamehere>`` for each input, in the new
   task class
3. Define methods named ``out_<yournamehere>()`` for each output, that
   return ``sciluigi.TargetInfo`` objects. (sciluigi.TargetInfo is
   initialized with a reference to the task object itself - typically
   ``self`` - and a path name, where upstream tasks paths can be used).
4. Define luigi parameters to the task.
5. Implement the ``run()`` method of the task.

Example:
^^^^^^^^

Let's define a simple task that just writes "foo" to a file named
``foo.txt``:

.. code:: python

    class MyFooWriter(sciluigi.Task):
        # We have no inputs here
        # Define outputs:
        def out_foo(self):
            return sciluigi.TargetInfo(self, 'foo.txt')
        def run(self):
            with self.out_foo().open('w') as foofile:
                foofile.write('foo\n')

Then, let's create a task that replaces "foo" with "bar":

.. code:: python

    class MyFooReplacer(sciluigi.Task):
        replacement = sciluigi.Parameter() # Here, we take as a parameter
                                      # what to replace foo with.
        # Here we have one input, a "foo file":
        in_foo = None
        # ... and an output, a "bar file":
        def out_replaced(self):
            # As the path to the returned target(info), we
            # use the path of the foo file:
            return sciluigi.TargetInfo(self, self.in_foo().path + '.bar.txt')
        def run(self):
            with self.in_foo().open() as in_f:
                with self.out_replaced().open('w') as out_f:
                    # Here we see that we use the parameter self.replacement:
                    out_f.write(in_f.read().replace('foo', self.replacement))

The last lines, we could have instead written using the command-line
``sed`` utility, available in linux, by calling it on the commandline,
with the built-in ``ex()`` method:

.. code:: python

        def run(self):
            # Here, we use the in-built self.ex() method, to execute commands:
            self.ex("sed 's/foo/{repl}/g' {inpath} > {outpath}".format(
                repl=self.replacement,
                inpath=self.in_foo().path,
                outpath=self.out_replaced().path))

Write the workflow definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, we can use these two tasks we created, to create a simple workflow,
in our workflow class, that we also created above.

We do this by:

1. Instantiating the tasks, using the
   ``self.new_task(<unique_taskname>, <task_class>, *args, **kwargs)``
   method, of the workflow task.
2. Connect the tasks together, by pointing the right ``out_*`` method to
   the right ``in_*`` field.
3. Returning the last task in the chain, from the workflow method.

Example:
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    import sciluigi
    class MyWorkflow(sciluigi.WorkflowTask):
        def workflow(self):
            foowriter = self.new_task('foowriter', MyFooWriter)
            fooreplacer = self.new_task('fooreplacer', MyFooReplacer,
                replacement='bar')

            # Here we do the *magic*: Connecting outputs to inputs:
            fooreplacer.in_foo = foowriter.out_foo

            # Return the last task(s) in the workflow chain.
            return fooreplacer

Add a run method to the end of the script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, the only thing that remains, is adding a run method to the end of
the script.

You can use luigi's own ``luigi.run()``, or our own two methods:

1. ``sciluigi.run()``
2. ``sciluigi.run_local()``

The ``run_local()`` one, is handy if you don't want to run a central
scheduler daemon, but just want to run the workflow as a script.

Both of the above take the same options as ``luigi.run()``, so you can
for example set the main class to use (our workflow task):

::

    # End of script ....
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        sciluigi.run_local(main_task_cls=MyWorkflow)

Run the workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, you should be able to run the workflow as simple as:

.. code:: bash

    python myworkflow.py

... provided of course, that the workflow is saved in a file named
myworkflow.py.

The basic idea behind SciLuigi, and a preceding solution to it, was
presented in workshop (e-Infra MPS 2015) talk: -
`Slides <http://www.slideshare.net/SamuelLampa/building-workflows-with-spotifys-luigi>`__
- `Video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f26PqSXZdWM>`__

See also `this collection of
links <http://bionics.it/posts/our-experiences-using-spotifys-luigi-for-bioinformatics-workflows>`__,
to more of our reported experiences using Luigi, which lead up to the
creation of SciLuigi.

Known Limitations
-----------------

-  Changing the workflow scheduling based on data sent as parameters, is
   not possible.
-  If you have an unknown number of outputs from a task, for which you
   want to start a full branch of the workflow, this is not possible
   either.

Both of the limitations are due to the fact that Luigi does scheduling
and execution separately (with the exception of Luigi's `dynamic
dependencies <http://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tasks.html#dynamic-dependencies>`__,
but they work only for upstream tasks, not downstream tasks, which we
would need).

If you run into any of these problems, you might be interested in an
experimental workflow engine we develop to overcome these limitations:
`SciPipe <http://scipipe.org/>`__.
